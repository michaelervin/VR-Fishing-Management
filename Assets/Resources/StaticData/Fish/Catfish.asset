  description: 'This fish eats just about anything, mostly live baits though. They
    tend to prefer to sit towards the bottom which is why some call them bottom feeders
    or "garbage fish". The blue catfish is known to be caught with fish sticking
    out of its mouth because they never stop eatting. '
